# Cole's FBLA Knowledge Quiz
This is Cole Cestaro's Mobile Application. I am from John Handley High School. The app is a 10 question quiz of different FBLA topics. The app includes a terms and conditions view, introduction, instructions, social media integration, and a bug reporting screen. I used my brother's Mac, and his Apple developer account, to create the app. That is why some files use his developer account ID. Though, I completely designed and developed everything myself.
# Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
# Installation Instructions
1. Download the "Quiz App for FBLA 2" project on a Mac computer
2. Import the project into Xcode
3. Run the simulator - The app looks the best on the iPhone 8 but it can be simulated on any iPhone.
# Quiz Instructions
If running the app in the simulator, the terms and conditions page requires a click and drag with your mouse to continue. The navigation is straight forward. Buttons with directions will guide you through the app. You will be asked 10 FBLA related questions. Select the best option. Depending on your answer, you will either be moved to a "correct" or "incorrect" screen. From there, tap anywhere on the screen to advance to the explanation. Tap once more to go to the next question. You can skip and go back to questions using the labeled side buttons. You can answer questions as many times as you want, but your first answer is calculated in the score. Click the top-right "Finish" button to finish the quiz at any time. This app is a quiz to test your FBLA knowledge, so try your best! This will also hopefully be a great educational tool for you.
